Though this was a bit challenging implying basic knowledge to realistic build, I can't wait to build more cool apps and be a better developer in the future. I'm glad I can share my thoughts to the world!\n\nEnjoy my personal blog, and let's reach for the sky!\n\nP.S. make sure to read only, since this is my personal diary :)",
