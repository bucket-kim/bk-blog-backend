I knew that if I set the folder to my local storage, it's not possible for people to see my blog publicly. For that matter, I need to find a different method to save the data, and somehow make it public. This time, I'm going to fix my blog with MongoDB so I have AWS cloud storage, so that it's saved on a safe cloud, and also people can actually see it.

This blog is a full stack build, applying what I learned from my online class. I used Node JS to build REST API. Though this was a bit challenging implying basic knowledge to realistic build, I can't wait to build more cool apps and be a better developer in the future. I'm glad I can share my thoughts to the world!\n\nEnjoy my personal blog, and let's reach for the sky!\n\nP.S. make sure to read only, since this is my personal diary :)","post_image":"uploads/post_image-1617929237579.png","added_date":"1617929237611"}]
